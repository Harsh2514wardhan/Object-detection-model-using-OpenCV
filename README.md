# Object-detection-model-using-OpenCV
This repository contains an object detection model built using OpenCV. It demonstrates how to detect various objects in images or videos using pre-trained models like Haar Cascades, HOG + Linear SVM, or deep learning-based methods. The project includes code for real-time detection, visualization, and object tracking.
