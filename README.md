Pillar Detection Model using OpenCV
Overview
This repository implements an object detection model specifically designed for detecting pillars in images or videos. The model utilizes OpenCV for real-time object detection and is built using pre-trained models and custom techniques suited for pillar detection. This project provides code for pillar detection, visualization, and tracking.

Features
Pillar Detection: Detects and classifies pillars in images or video frames.
Real-Time Detection: Performs detection in real-time from video streams or images.
Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected pillars.
Tracking: Tracks detected pillars across multiple frames in video.
Prerequisites
To run the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Install required libraries via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
How It Works
The model uses Haar Cascades, HOG + SVM, or deep learning-based object detection methods to identify pillars in an image. The detection is optimized for pillar shapes and sizes.

Steps:
Preprocessing: The input image or video is preprocessed to improve detection accuracy.
Detection: The model identifies pillars using a chosen detection method.
Bounding Boxes: Detected pillars are highlighted with bounding boxes.
Tracking: In case of video input, the pillars are tracked across frames.
Usage
To run the detection on an image, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python detect_pillars.py --image path_to_image.jpg
For video detection:

bash
Copy code
python detect_pillars.py --video path_to_video.mp4
Example
